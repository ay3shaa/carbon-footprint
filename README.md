# Carbon Footprint Calculator

## Project Overview
An AI-powered Carbon Footprint Calculator that estimates the annual CO₂ emissions of an individual based on their lifestyle habits (travel, energy consumption, food choices, and other daily activities).

Using the Individual Carbon Footprint dataset from Kaggle, the system applies data preprocessing, machine learning, and visualization techniques to: 
       - Predict carbon emissions from user inputs.
       - Analyze key factors contributing to a person’s footprint.
       - Provide personalized recommendations to reduce environmental impact.

The project demonstrates the role of AI & ML in sustainability, highlighting how data-driven insights can support energy efficiency and eco-friendly decision-making.
